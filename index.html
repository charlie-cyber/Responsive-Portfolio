      <p>-About me well…um…let’s see…. went to Middle Georgia College and State University. Landed a job with BMW for 5 years, left there picked up a Nikon about 2 years ago and starting doing free-lance photography did a lot of cool stuff with it. Some how landed a job with apple at the same time I decided to pursue this journey with coding. I enjoy listening to music, gaming, photography, and watching anime. I only have one chance at life so why not enjoy it?</p>
